                <p> Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter born in 1840. He is known as 
                    the founder of impressionist painting and recognized for his paintings of nature 
                    and the world around him. Although he died in 1926, he is still seen as one of the most
                    famous Western painters of all time. You can find his paintings displayed 
                    in multiple museums across the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
                    and the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.
